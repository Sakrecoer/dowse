The Dowse network visualization shown in the exibition is designed and developed by **Denis "Jaromil" Roio**, who published it along with the Dowse Whitepaper in 2013. Soon Jaromil was joined by **Rob van Kranenburg** who has woven the Dowse narrative to a wider perspective on the Internet of Things, and by **Federico Bonelli** who ran workshops in various schools using Dowse.

The project has been funded by **SIDN Fonds** and received the ISOC NL Prize 2016.

The Dowse software includes code contributions by **Luca Greco, Ivan Jelinčić, Andrea Scarpino, Nicola Rossi and Danilo Spinella**, and is based on the **DNSCrypt Proxy v2** framework by **Frank Denis**. **Jaromil** is still the current maintainer and accepts contributions via Dyne.org.
