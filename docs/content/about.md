title: About Dowse
description_markdown: "The Internet of Things hype generates a ton of buzz about things
  that will be allowed to connect to the internet and talk to other devices. This buzz
  requires attention. Things like home appliances should have a clear behaviour and a
  simple switch to put them off. \n\nDowse puts this switch back to any device in your LAN."

  content_markdown: "Dowse talks back to your devices. It uses open standards: MQTT,
    Websockets, Open Sound Control. So many types of devices can treasure the messages
    that Dowse publishes to turn them to action. It is a good starting point for artists,
    hobbyists and makers to create amazing network-aware effects and interfaces. \n\n**We try
    to help a community of dowsers to explore this possibility.**"

  content_markdown: "Your local area network should be a safe-sapce. A zone of peace of mind.
  Knowing what happens in the digital realm can seem like worrysome sorcery or black-magic.\n\n
  **Dowse is meant to help you preserve the peace of mind by creating awareness and
  demystifying the communication taking place between your devices.**"

## What is Dowse?

<iframe width="100%" height="460" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wDLyYk_TQtI?si=E9j_UJs_SwmCN6gc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Dowse box gives you back control. Dowse is *free and open source software*. There is no big company behind it. By installing the Dowse box you will get insight down to the network layer of what is *actually* going on in your home. Who is talking to whom, what, where and when? You can see which device connects to which company and you can turn that communication off, or allow it.

We call it an *"Awareness Box"*. You will be aware of the invisible world surrounding you and your familly. To us, this is the first step. Dowse is building a [community of developers](/community) who will create modules allowing you to safely and securely share your data with whomever you want. After all there are a lot of pros about getting insight into your own behavior, your family's and your home as a companion. Yet the control should stay with you. You will share if you know what you are really sharing.

In short, it is a device that is designed to do a few things very well:

- Opacize your network; External services will *not be able to capture your metadata and/or your data* through Domain Name System Translation.
- Makes you aware of your traffic and all activities of your users without spying on them. It is a bit like sharing the same room.
- Allows you to *swich off devices' and machines' network connection* in case they wish to "call home" because they have been infected by malware, or they have been ill conceived to serve commercial spyware purpose.

And we added to the mix:
- Open Sound Control
- MQTT
- NETDATA
- Websockets and all the good stuff to play with it.
- Hardware Hacking with ESP8266 and Arduino
- Programmable with NODERED


## Idea: Responsible Networking

Running a network in the age of the Internet of Things means hosting the connectivity of multiple devices owned by a diversity of subjects. Often such devices have full access to private, common and public information about humans operating them. Furthermore, devices can talk to each other without humans even asking and such interactions
are not even manifest. This situation raises issues that are not just technical, but socio-political, about the way connections happen without human consent, within local networks and towards the outside, to and from the Internet.

In such a scenario it becomes of crucial importance for home users and professionals to have a clear overview of what goes in and out of the network they are running: be it the LAN space they are offering to guests at home or the office network they are sharing with co-workers.

## Concept
Dowse is not only a functional tool, but a symbolic operation proposing a different linguistic approach to networking. In conceptualizing and documenting Dowse all references to military traits are removed: there is no use of “defense”, “shield”, “guardian” or “firewall” words.

The way privacy awareness (rather than protection) is presented to its users is not envisioned as a violent process, but as a responsible, natural act in search of harmony among the things connecting the inside with the outside of one’s private, common and public aspects of life.
