  description_markdown: "Connected things like home appliances should have a clear behaviour humans
    can understand and react upon. This includes a simple switch to turn them off. Dowse gives an ON/OFF
    switch back to any device in your LAN."

  description_markdown: "Dowse talks back to your devices. In open standards: MQTT, Websockets,
    Open Sound Control. Many types of Internet connected things can treasure the messages that
    Dowse publishes, to turn them into action. Is a good start for artists, hobbyists and
    makers to create amazing network-aware effects, visualisations and interfaces. We try to
    help a community of dowsers to explore this possibility. Share your dowse projects with us."

    things as well: it switches their access to internet off. \n\nDowse is a open source project.
    Experts can look at is code. It is built to last and to be used by anyone because is a
    community project. **If you are interested in us giving workshops...**"

Dowse processes all DNS network connections on its network and makes them visible in real-time, showing when we connect to .com or .org or .net domains, or to the corporate cloud of social networks. This way we can immediately see how many connections are opened by our personal devices, without us even knowing, every time we connect to a network.
